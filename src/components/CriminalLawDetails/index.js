                <h2>Criminal Law</h2>
                <h5>
                  Criminal law is the most widely known area of legal practice,
                  with work ranging from motoring offences and murder, to white
                  collar crimes like fraud and corruption.{" "}
                </h5>
                <p>
                  The majority of criminal defence solicitors will work in areas
                  of general crime, usually in a high street law firm or larger
                  firms focusing on a range of publicly funded work. Some
                  general criminal law firms have the capacity and expertise to
                  undertake white collar crime, although this is traditionally
                  undertaken by specialist firms.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  However donâ€™t forget, defence work is only one side of the
                  equation. There is also prosecution: the Crown Prosecution
                  Service (CPS) is the principle prosecuting body in England and
                  Wales, in addition to the other agencies, such as the Serious
                  Fraud Office and HM Revenue & Customs.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  The work of a solicitor practising in crime will vary
                  considerably depending on the type of criminal work undertaken
                  and whether he/she is a defence or prosecution solicitor.{" "}
